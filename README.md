# HTML Linter - Ruby Capstone Project

> This is the [Capstone Project for the Ruby module](https://www.notion.so/Build-your-own-linter-b17a3c22f7b940c98ca1980250720769) of the Microverse program. The main goal of this project is to put into practice the concepts of **Methods**, **Classes**, **Modules** and **Testing.** in Ruby. 

## About the Project

As its name suggest, the HTML-linter enforces some basic HTML5 rules and good pratices recommended by w3school article [HTML Style Guide and Coding Conventions](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp).

### Rules sample

1. The document should contain the tags`<!DOCTYPE> <html> <head> <body> <title>`. Attributes are optional. The lint match only if the tag is at the start of a line or after whitespaces. 

**Good**
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
```

**Bad**
```
<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en">
```
2. All tags and attribute must be in lowercase, except !DOCTYPE

**Good**
```
<html lang="en">
```

**Bad**
```
<Html LANG="en">
```
3. Tag exists and is a valid HTML5 tag

**Good**
```
<section>
```

**Bad**
```
<sections>
```
4. No whitspace between an attribute and its value if any

**Good**
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
```

**Bad**
```
<link rel=    "stylesheet" href   =  "styles.css" />
```
